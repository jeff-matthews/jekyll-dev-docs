  tokenization-definition: Tokenization is the process of sending payment details (e.g., credit card/bank account numbers) to a secure PCI DSS-compliant payment gateway in exchange for a one-time token. The token can be used to make a payment, but it must be used along with the merchantâ€™s secret key. Our [Getting Started Guide](../guides/payment-form-getting-started.html) walks you through the process.

  partner-apps-description: Use our REST APIs to integrate your application with the AffiniPay Payment Gateway. Our APIs facilitate merchant credit card and automated clearing house (ACH) payment processing.
  payment-forms-description: Use our REST APIs and JavaScript tokenization library to build payment collection forms on your website. Avoid the cost and liability of maintaining a PCI DSS-compliant environment and send sensitive payment information to AffiniPay's PCI-compliant payment gateway instead.
