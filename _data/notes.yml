  payment-form-tip: <span class="panel-tip"><b>Tip:</b> If you're building a payment form for your website, you don't need to contact support to create an application. Refer to the [Payment Form Getting Started Guide](../guides/payment-form-getting-started.html) for more information.</span>
  oauth-partner-app: <span class="panel-note"><b>Note:</b> If you don't see any applications, you must <a href="mailto:devsupport@affinipay.com">contact support</a> and ask an AffiniPay employee to create one for you.</span>
  revoke-app-auth: <span class="panel-note"><b>Note:</b> Merchant users can revoke authorization from your application at any time from within the AffiniPay web application.</span>
  oauth-client-credentials: <span class="panel-note"><b>Note:</b> You must have an <span class="code-green">access_token</span> to call this endpoint. Use the <a href="../basics/authentication.html#client-credentials">Client Credentials</a> OAuth flow to acquire an <span class="code-green">access_token</span>.
  form-styles-conjunction: <span class="panel-note"><b>Note:</b> This style is intended to be used in conjunction with one or more of the card and bank styles to supplement the details requested.</span>
  tokenization-definition: Tokenization is the process of sending payment details (e.g., credit card/bank account numbers) to a secure PCI DSS-compliant payment gateway in exchange for a one-time token. The token can be used to make a payment, but it must be used along with the merchantâ€™s <a href="../guides/payment-form-getting-started.html#obtain-credentials">secret key</a>.
  chargeio-is-gateway: <span class="panel-note"><b>Note:</b> The base URL for making calls to the AffiniPay Payment Gateway API (formerly known as "chargeIO") is <span class="code-green">https://api.chargeio.com/v1/</span>.
  partner-apps-description: If you want to provide payment processing capabilities to AffiniPay merchants (e.g., professional services firms, member organizations, or non-profits) through your application, use our payment gateway API. Our API facilitates merchant credit card and automated clearing house (ACH) payment processing.
  payment-forms-description: Use our REST APIs and JavaScript tokenization library to build payment collection forms on your website. Avoid the cost and liability of maintaining a PCI DSS-compliant environment and send sensitive payment information to AffiniPay's PCI-compliant payment gateway instead.
  no-encoded-values: <p><span class="panel-note"><b>Note:</b> All parameter values included in a request must be in plain text format. This API doesn't accept encoded values.</span></p>
  pagination: The API supports pagination over the result set by allowing the client to specify the number of results per logical "page" and the page to view. The following URL parameters are supported&#58;
required-payment-fields: <div class="panel-warning"><b>Important:</b> You must include all required payment fields in the token request (e.g., address, city, state, ZIP code, country, email, phone, etc). Required payment fields are defined in your AffiniPay merchant account configuration. <p>To review required payment fields:</p><ol><li>Log in to <a href="https://secure.affinipay.com/login" target="&#95;blank">https://secure.affinipay.com/login</a>.<span class="tooltip" title="LawPay users should go to https://secure.lawpay.com/login"><i class="fa fa-info-circle superscript"></i></span></li><li>Click <b>Settings</b> > <b>My Business</b> and scroll down to the <b>Accounts</b> section.</li><li>Click <b>Edit</b> next to an account.</li><li>Review the account's <b>Required Payment Field</b> policies. Checked boxes denote required fields.</li></ol><p>Omitting required fields when creating a token will result in failed payment attempts when using the token.</p></div>
use-tokens: If you choose <em>not</em> to use <a href="../basics/tokenization.html">tokens</a> and  plan on handling sensitive cardholder data yourself, you'll need to implement robust security policies and comply with <a href="../basics/overview.html#pci-compliance">more stringent PCI requirements</a>.
