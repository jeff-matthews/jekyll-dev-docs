      <p>A <span class="code-green">not_authorized_country_denied</span> error indicates an operation was attempted from an IP in a country not allowed by the policy in effect. This error is typically recorded on failed transactions, and is not returned directly in an API response for security reasons, to avoid providing additional context to a potential attacker.</p>
