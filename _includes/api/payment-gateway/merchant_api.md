Merchant API
=============
-------------

The Merchant API provides REST URLs for Merchants to process credit card and automated clearing house (ACH) payments
from their customers. Merchant management APIs provide a means of viewing and editing details of the merchant and
associated accounts. Through the transaction APIs, merchants can accept and refund payments from customer cards
or bank accounts and view and search transactions. And the payment method APIs
support secure storage and retrieval of payment details from customers for both one-time and repeat use.
