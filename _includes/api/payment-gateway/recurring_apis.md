      <p>The Gateway's recurring charge support makes it easy to collect payments from
      your customers on an ongoing, scheduled basis &mdash; from simple donations to more complicated installment plans. Start by <a href="../reference/api.html#create-recurring-charge" target="&#95;">creating a new recurring charge</a>: you define how much to collect, a payment method to use, the payment schedule, and optional limits. The Gateway tracks each scheduled payment using an <a href="../reference/api.html#recurringchargeoccurrence" target="&#95;">occurrence</a> instance, which lets you know the status of the payment and what transaction(s) were created to collect that payment. Through the APIs, you can <a href="../reference/api.html#list-recurring-charges" target="&#95;">view</a> all your recurring charges and their associated <a href="../reference/api.html#list-occurrences" target="&#95;">occurrences</a>, <a href="../reference/api.html#update-recurring-charge" target="&#95;">edit</a> recurring charges, and perform <a href="../reference/api.html#pay-occurrence" target="&#95;">operations</a> on individual payments.</p>
