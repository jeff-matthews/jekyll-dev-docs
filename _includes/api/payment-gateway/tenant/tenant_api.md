Tenant APIs
=============
-------------

The Tenant API provides REST URLs for manipulating the Tenant's
[Merchants](types#merchant-section), the [Merchant Accounts](types#merchantaccount-section)
and [ACH Accounts](types#achaccount-section) used by those Merchants for payment processing,
and the Policies applied.
