AffiniPay provides all merchants with a public key and test- and live-mode secret keys to authenticate to the {{site.data.variables.brand.gateway-api}}. Using the test-mode secret key, you can start using the API immediately without actually submitting charges to the payment processing networks. When you're ready to start processing payments, just switch to your live-mode secret key.

<span class="panel-note"><b>Note:</b> Your secret keys provide access to sensitive operations affecting payments and therefore **must** be closely guarded. Never expose these keys in any publicly-accessible web pages, JavaScript, etc. If you suspect your test- or live-mode secret keys have been compromised, <a href="https://affinipay.com/support/" target="&#95;blank">contact</a> AffiniPay immediately to reset your secret keys.

The secret key you specify when making an API request affects how the operation is processed. The test-mode secret key only allows you to create new charges and other transactions against <span class="code-green">TEST</span> accounts, while the live-mode secret key only works in conjunction with accounts associated with live payment processing networks. Attempts to mix secret keys and accounts will fail.
