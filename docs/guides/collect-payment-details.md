You'll need to design and build a form to collect payment details. Whether you're building an application integration or a web page, we recommend that you secure payment details you collect using our [JavaScript tokenization library](../basics/tokenization.html). Our JavaScript tokenization library enables you to send payment details to AffiniPay's PCI-compliant servers in exchange for a token that your server can use to:

-   [Create charges](../guides/create-charge.html)
-   [Set up recurring charges](../guides/setup-recurring-charge.html)
-   [Save payment details for future use](../guides/save-payment-details.html)

Refer to the [Payment Form Getting Started Guide](../guides/payment-form-getting-started.html#create-a-payment-form) to see an example form.
