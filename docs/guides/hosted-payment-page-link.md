The easiest way to collect a payment online is to provide a link to one of our pre-built hosted payment pages. You can embed this link in your website or email it directly to a customer.

If you know a customer's contact details, you can pre-populate those fields by manually or programmatically [adding URL parameters](#pre-populate-form-fields-with-url-parameters) to the link. When a customer navigates to the payment page, all they need to do is enter their payment details. You can even make pre-populated fields read-only so customers can't make changes.
