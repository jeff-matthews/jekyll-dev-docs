The easiest way to collect a payment online is to provide a link to one of our pre-built hosted payment pages.

To get a link to a hosted payment page:

<ol>
  <li>Log in to the AffiniPay web application by going to <a href="https://secure.affinipay.com/login" target="&#95;blank">https://secure.affinipay.com</a>.<span class="tooltip" title="LawPay users should go to https://secure.lawpay.com/login"><i class="fa fa-info-circle superscript"></i></span></li>
  <li>Click <b>New Charge</b> in the left menu.</li>
  <li>Locate the payment page that you want to link to and click <b>Actions</b> > <b>Show & Copy Page Link</b>.</li>
  <li>Copy the link.

</ol>
