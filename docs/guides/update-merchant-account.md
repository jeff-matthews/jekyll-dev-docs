As an AffiniPay merchant, there may be times when you need to update your business information, bank account details, or merchant account policy configuration (e.g., CVV and AVS rules). The {{site.data.variables.brand.gateway-api}} provides endpoints for managing this information. The full list of endpoints and operations is available <a href="../reference/api.html#MerchantManagement" target="&#95;blank">here</a>.

<span class="panel-note"><b>Note:</b> You must use your {{site.data.variables.brand.gateway}} credentials (i.e., <a href="../guides/payment-form-getting-started.html#obtain-credentials">secret key</a>) when making the API call to update your account.</span>
