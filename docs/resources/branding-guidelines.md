AffiniPay offers more than one payment solution to help professionals process credit card and Automated Clearing House (ACH) transactions. Our payment solutions include:

- <a href="https://affinipay.com/" target="&#95;blank"><b>AffiniPay</b></a> -  The payment solution designed specifically for associations.
- <a href="https://lawpay.com/" target="&#95;blank"><b>LawPay</b></a> - The payment solution designed specifically for law firms.
- <a href="https://cpacharge.com/" target="&#95;blank"><b>CPACharge</b></a> - The payment solution designed specifically for Certified Public Accountants (CPA) firms.

You should represent the branding of the specific integrated payment solution when prompting users to log in to your application for the first time using their AffiniPay account credentials. The best way to represent the brand is by using one of our logos.

## Button Design

Your application must include a button that initiates the OAuth flow between a merchant user's AffiniPay account and your application. Follow these design guidelines:

 - **AffiniPay Logo** - Use the logo that corresponds to the AffiniPay payment solution you've integrated with your application. Click [here](../downloads/affinipay_logos.zip) to download our logos.
 - **Size** - You can scale buttons and logos to meet your size requirements, but make sure the aspect ratio is locked when doing so to prevent stretching or otherwise distorting the logo.
 - **Text** - Use the text "Sign in with..." and append it with either "AffiniPay", "LawPay", or "CPACharge".

Here are examples of acceptable logo use:

<a class="btn-large" style="background-color: #fff; color: gray; text-transform: none; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><img style="vertical-align: middle; padding-right: 10px;" src="../images/sign-in-affinipay-logo.png"/>Sign in with AffiniPay</a>

<a class="btn-large" style="background-color: #fff; color: gray; text-transform: none; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><img style="vertical-align: middle; padding-right: 10px;" src="../images/sign-in-lawpay-logo.png"/>Sign in with LawPay</a>

<a class="btn-large" style="background-color: #fff; color: gray; text-transform: none; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><img style="vertical-align: middle; padding-right: 10px;" src="../images/sign-in-cpacharge-logo.png"/>Sign in with CPACharge</a>

<!--### Color
