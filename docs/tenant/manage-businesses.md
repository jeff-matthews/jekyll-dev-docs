Why take on the liabilities associated with storing large amounts of sensitive customer data when you don't have to? [Security is our top priority](../basics/overview.html#security). Take advantage of our PCI-compliant technology and infrastructure to store all customer contact information and payment details.

There are two methods for managing businesses:

- **API** - Use our Businesses API to programmatically create new customers in bulk or migrate all your existing customer records to the AffiniPay system. Refer to the <a href="/tenant/index.html" data-proofer-ignore target="&#95;blank">Businesses API Reference</a> for more information.
- **Businesses Dashboard** - Use the Businesses dashboard in the AffiniPay web application to create new customers or update existing customer details without help from a developer. This topic guides you through creating and updating businesses through the Businesses dashboard.
